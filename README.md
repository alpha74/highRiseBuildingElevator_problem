# High Rise Building Elevator Problem

### Problem Statement
Consider a high rise building having floors >= 200. We have to design an algorithm for `elevator` system.

Given the number of lifts as N and M people are requesting the lifts rapidly.

Design an algorithm which would solve these problems:
- Minimise the wait time for each lift.
- In morning, a lot of people will be going to theie offices. Hence, load would be high between 8-9am.
- In evening, a lot of people would be going down so load will be high but it will be random.
- Avoid the situation when a lift arrives and it is full.
